# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

TODO: build an api that will verify

An app that will allow for giveaways to be done in a truly random way
User will set up a lottery and to win you must reply to the site with your twitter handle
fans will go to the site and interact with the contract to be entered into the giveaway
connect contract to twitter account
When contract has been interacted with it will tweet out Username has entered the giveaway

after a set amount of time a chainlink keeper will call the end lottery function and will select a winner
winner will be displayed on the lottery card and in the future it will mint an nft
